## Hi everyone, I'm Lutao. Today I'm going to talk about object detection.

Since 1950, when computer vision just emerge as a psychological method, the task of recognition has been studied for many years.  

Object detection, as one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. 

The aiming is to detect instances of visual objects of certain classes in digital images such as photos or video frames. The goal of object detection is to develop computational models that provide the most fundamental information needed by computer vision applications: “What objects are where?”.

Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as the epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of the cold weapon era.

As is known to us all, detectors, datasets and metrics take an essential role in deep learning-based methods. And it is the framework of the detectors that counts. So in my speech, I will demonstrate the history of the legacy milestone detectors.

As is shown in this figure, it is what happened during the past two decades.

== If you have read some papers regarding this field, or its downstream application, like face detection or pedestrian detection, you must be familiar with several keywords, like RCNN, YOLO, HOG. 
Then you have to admit you are pretty a lucky dog to be born in the twenty-first century, as what the programmers had suffered in the late 1990s might be far beyond your imagination. 

## So here comes the classical methods.

Although it seems to be a very simple process, the calculation behind it was far beyond the computer's power of its time. The VJ detector has dramatically improved its detection speed by incorporating three important techniques: ``integral image'', ``feature selection'', and ``detection cascades''. It requires optimization techniques, computational tricks and many handcrafted features.

Years later, HOG brings out scale-invariant   feature transform and shape contexts. Although it is designed for person Reid, its detector has long been an important foundation of many object detectors and a large variety of computer vision applications for many years.

Then, 2012 is the milestone for CNN, when Alex proposed AlexNet. A deep convolutional network is able to learn robust and high-level feature representations of an image. 

In the deep learning era, object detection can be grouped into two genres: “two-stage detection” and “one-stage detection”, where the former frames the detection as a “coarse-to-fine” process while the later frames it as “complete in one step”.

## So firstly, let's talk about Two-stage Detectors.

In 2014, RCNN used a CNN by proposing the Regions and brought the deep learning era for object detection.

Later that year, SPPNet proposed Spatial Pyramid Pooling to share the convolutional features.

In 2015,  Fast RCNN combined SPP and RCNN and made inference cost-efficiently. 

Soon, Faster RCNN used an RPN neck to realise the first end to end training pipeline. 

In 2017, FPN proposed Feature Pyramid to detect objects with a wide variety of scales. 

## Then we gonna talk about One-stage models

YOLO was the first one-stage detector in the deep learning era. Its first version was published in 2015, and the second version in 2017.

Also in 2015, SSD introduced the multi-scale technique and had advantages in terms of both detection speed and accuracy.

In 2017, RetinaNet used the focal loss to handle class imbalance caused by the dataset. 

The new loss is simple in the formula, but performs well in practice. 

## So here comes the Conclusion:

Remarkable achievements have been made in object detection over the past 20 years. Although a great effort has been made in recent years, the speed gap between a machine and human eyes remains large, especially for detecting some small objects.、

With many open questions unsolved, the field of object detection needs your help.

## These are the reference part.

And that's all. Thank you for your time.
