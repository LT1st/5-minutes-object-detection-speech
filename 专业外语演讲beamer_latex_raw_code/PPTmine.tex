\section{Classical}
\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]

        \item The VJ detector has dramatically improved its detection speed by incorporating three important techniques: ``integral image'', ``feature selection'', and ``detection cascades''. 
        \item It requires optimization techniques , computational optimization tricks and many handcrafted features.

        \tiem and a large variety of computer vision applications for many years.

\section{Two-stage}
\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2012 is the milestone for CNN, when Alex proposed AlexNet\cite{alexnet}.
        \item A deep convolutional network is able to learn robust and high-level feature representations of an image. 
        \item In deep learning era, object detection can be grouped into two genres: 
        “two-stage detection” and “one-stage detection”, 
        where the former frames the detection as a “coarse-to-fine” process 
        while the later frames it as to “complete in one step”.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{NOT end to end}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Then in 2014, RCNN used a CNN by proposing the Regions and brought the deep learning era for object detection.
        \item Later in that year, SPPNet\cite{sppnet} proposed Spatial Pyramid Pooling to share the convolutional features.
        \item In 2015,  Fast RCNN\cite{fast} combined SPP and RCNN and made inference cost efficiently. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{end to end}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item  In 2017, RetinaNet used focal loss to handle class imbalance caused by dataset.
        \begin{equation}
            L(y, \hat{p})
= -\alpha y \left(1 - \hat{p}\right)^\gamma \log(\hat{p})

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{}

Remarkable achievements have been made in object detection over the past 20 years. Although a great effort has been made in recent years, the speed gap between a machine and human eyes still remains large, especially for detecting some small objects. With many open questions unsolved, the field of object detection still needs your help.
